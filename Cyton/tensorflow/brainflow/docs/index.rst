Welcome to BrainFlow's documentation!
=====================================

Brainflow is a library intended to obtain, parse and analyze EEG\EMG\ECG data from BCI boards.

We are supporting two versions of this library:

- `OpenBCI\'s fork <https://github.com/OpenBCI/brainflow>`_

These versions are exactly the same, choose one and use it
