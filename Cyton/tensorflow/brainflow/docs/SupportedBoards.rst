Ganglion geting started guide from `OpenBCI 
<https://docs.openbci.com/Tutorials/00-Tutorials>`_.

API params:

- board Id: 1
- port: for Windows - Ganglion Mac address which you can get using Bluetooth Low Energy Explorer from Microsoft Store (e.g. e6:73:73:18:09:b1) for Windows autodiscovery works so you can pass empty string as well, for Linux/MacOS you need to pass string in format "dongle_port,mac_addr"(e.g./dev/ttyACM0,e6:73:73:18:09:b1) to get mac address on Linux you can use hcitool

System Requirements:

- Windows >= 10/Linux/MacOS
- For Python and C# we support x86/x64 libraries, for other bindings x64 only
- If you use python bindings installed from PYPI on Windows you may need to install `redist_x64 <https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe>`_ or `redist_x86 <https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe>`_  (but more likely you have it preinstalled)
- For Linux/MacOS you need to use dongle, for Windows dongle is not required if you have Bluetooth on your laptop

Board Spec:

- num eeg channels: 4
- num acceleration channels: 3
- sampling rate: 200
- communication: Bluetooth Low Energy
